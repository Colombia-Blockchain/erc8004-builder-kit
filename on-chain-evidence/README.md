# On-Chain Evidence

This directory contains decoded on-chain transactions proving that ERC-8004 agents #1686 and #1687 are real, registered, and interacting.

All transactions can be independently verified on [Snowtrace](https://snowtrace.io) (Avalanche) or [8004scan.io](https://8004scan.io).

- [Registration Transactions](registration-transactions.md) — Agent registration TX hashes
- [Feedback Transactions](feedback-transactions.md) — On-chain reputation feedback

## Why This Matters

On-chain evidence proves:
- Agents are registered with real NFTs (not just documentation)
- Feedback was submitted by real wallets (not simulated)
- The registration flow works end-to-end on mainnet
